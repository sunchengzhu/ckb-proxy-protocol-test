### Toggle random authentication for the proxy server.
### Default setting: true
###
### When enabled (true), CKB will generate a random username and password for each connection
### to the proxy server.
### For a Tor Server, this increases privacy by ensuring the proxy cannot correlate
### multiple connections.
### Refer to the 'IsolateSOCKSAuth' section in the following documentation:
### https://manpages.debian.org/testing/tor/torrc.5.en.html
###
### Important Note:
### If you are using a non-Tor SOCKS5 proxy that supports, but does not require authentication,
### enabling this may lead to connection rejections. In such cases, set proxy_random_auth to false.
# proxy_random_auth = true

# [network.onion]
### If CKB needs to run behind the Onion network,
### the user should start a Tor server and set [network.proxy.proxy_url] to Tor server's address.
### The default Tor SOCKS5 proxy URL is socks5://127.0.0.1:9050.
### For more information on configuring Tor, visit: https://linux.die.net/man/1/tor

### Enable or disable listening on the Onion network.
### When set to true, CKB will accept incoming connections over Tor.
### You can get the onion listening address in log, or by local_node_info RPC
# listen_on_onion = true

### The onion service will proxy incoming traffic to `p2p_listen_address`.
### If the CKB's peer-to-peer listen address is not set to the default 127.0.0.1
### with the port specified in `[network].listen_addresses` for IPv4, you should configure this field.
# p2p_listen_address = "127.0.0.1:8115"

### The address and port of the Tor SOCKS5 proxy server that CKB will use to establish
### outbound connections to other Onion services. If not set, it will use network.proxy.proxy_url
# onion_server = "127.0.0.1:9050"

### The address and port of the Tor ControlPort, which allows CKB to communicate with
### the Tor process for tasks like creating Onion services.
### Default: "127.0.0.1:9051"
# tor_controller = "127.0.0.1:9051"

### The password for authenticating with the Tor ControlPort.
### This should match the 'HashedControlPassword' set in your Tor configuration.
### Leave empty if no authentication is required.
# tor_password = ""

### The external port that the onion service will expose.
### This is the port that will be advertised in the onion address,
### while traffic will be forwarded to `p2p_listen_address`.

# Set the lock script to protect mined CKB.
#
# CKB uses CS architecture for miner. Miner process (ckb miner) gets block
# template from the Node process (ckb run) via RPC. Thus the lock script is
# configured in ckb.toml instead of ckb-miner.toml, and the config takes effect
# after restarting Node process.
#
# The `code_hash` identifies different cryptography algorithm. Read the manual
# of the lock script provider about how to generate this config.
#
# CKB provides an secp256k1 implementation, it requires a hash on the
# compressed public key. The hash algorithm is blake2b, with personal
# "ckb-default-hash". The first 160 bits (20 bytes) are used as the only arg.
#
# You can use any tool you trust to generate a Bitcoin private key and public
# key pair, which can be used in CKB as well. CKB CLI provides the function for
# you to convert the public key into block assembler configuration parameters.
#
# Here is an example using ckb-cli to generate an account, this command will
# print the block assembler args(lock_arg) to screen:
#
#     ckb-cli account new
#
# If you already have a raw secp256k1 private key, you can get the lock_arg by:
#
#     ckb-cli util key-info --privkey-path <privkey-path>
#
# The command `ckb init` also accepts options to generate the block assembler
# directly. See `ckb init --help` for details.
#
#     ckb init --ba-arg <lock_arg>
#

# [block_assembler]
